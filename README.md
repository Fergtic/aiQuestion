# aiQuestion
 
This website aims to achieve a Twitter like experience with the added feature that everyone is talking about the same thing: A highly Sophistacated AI's Question. With the attraction that everyday you have reason to return like many popular sites and apps that we have seen recently (BeReal, Wordle), it aims to attract the user's attention for 5 to 10 minutes a day as they post their thoughts about the AI's question, read and discuss with other anonymous users on the website.
